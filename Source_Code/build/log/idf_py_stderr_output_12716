CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory C:/Users/chris/Dropbox/PC/Desktop/Project/Redefining_Music_Media/Source_Code/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/Users/chris/Dropbox/PC/Desktop/Project/Redefining_Music_Media/sample_project/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "C:/Users/chris/Dropbox/PC/Desktop/Project/Redefining_Music_Media/Source_Code/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "C:/Users/chris/Dropbox/PC/Desktop/Project/Redefining_Music_Media/sample_project/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
